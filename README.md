**Title: The Role of Blockchain Technology in Transforming Supply Chain Management**** Abstract:**Blockchain technology is mostly known  for its role in cryptocurrencies, but it is more recognized for its work. capabilities. To improve the supply chain. This article explores how blockchain can improve delivery processes, reduce fraud, and enhance data management. With a comprehensive review, this article highlights the benefits, current applications, challenges, and future directions of blockchain in supply chain management. > Supply chain management (SCM) is the process of managing the flow of goods, information, and money from raw materials to the end customer. Supply chains typically involve many stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers. However, traditional materials face problems such as transparency, lack of capacity, and data security. Blockchain technology is a distributed and immutable digital data that provides solutions to these problems. Help solve supply chain problems to create efficiency and trust. Many computers record changes, making all changes immutable and transparent. Each "block" in the blockchain contains transaction information, and these blocks are connected over time to form a "chain". Unlike blockchain, it operates in a decentralized manner, which means that no single organization has full control. female gender. ### 3. Blockchain Applications in Supply Chain ManagementBlockchain can solve many major problems in supply chain management, such as counterfeiting, lack of transparency, and poor record keeping. br>#### 3.1. Traceability and TransparencyIn traditional products, it can be difficult to track the origin and history of the product. Blockchain can track products at every level of the chain in real time. For example,  pharmaceutical companies can track drugs throughout their journey  from  manufacturer to pharmacy to ensure consumers are getting the right product. Consumers can help reduce fraud by scanning QR codes to identify genuine products. Enhanced Data Security and IntegritySince data in  blockchain is immutable, it ensures data security and accuracy. Supply chains that contain sensitive information, such as the food industry, can use blockchain to secure production data  and expiration dates. Blockchain also provides an audit trail that makes it easier to track a productâs origin. Increase efficiency and reduce costs Blockchain reduces costs and increases efficiency by eliminating intermediaries in the transaction process. For example, traditional transactions in the supply chain often require multiple approvals from multiple institutions, which can slow down the process. Blockchain supports âsmart contracts,â which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules. The contract is executed when conditions are met,  saving time and reducing transaction costs. Reducing Fraud and Counterfeiting Counterfeit goods are a major problem in industries such as medical, luxury goods, and electronics. Blockchain provides secure and transparent tracking, making it harder for counterfeiters to access devices. Because each item has a digital ID on the blockchain, companies can quickly detect and remove counterfeit goods from the supply chain. Supply Chain Blockchain Case StudyMany businesses are adopting blockchain technology to increase supply chain transparency and security. Walmart and IBM Food TrustWalmart has partnered with IBM to create  IBM Food Trust, a blockchain solution designed to improve food safety. This process allows Walmart to track the origin of products in seconds, making it easier to detect contamination  and ensure food safety and quality. Maersk and TradeLensShipping company Maersk has partnered with IBM to create TradeLens, a blockchain-based platform for tracking shipments and reducing data. TradeLens provides instant information about containers, reducing delays, ensuring transparency, and simplifying international trade. De Beers Diamond TrackingDe Beers is a diamond company that uses blockchain to track diamonds from mining to retail. This helps prevent the sale of fakes and ensures that only genuine diamonds reach consumers. While blockchains have many benefits, there are also challenges that limit their widespread adoption. High cost Using blockchain technology can be expensive, especially for small businesses. Costs associated with new development, training, and integration with existing systems can be significant. Data privacy and governance issues The transparency of blockchain presents both benefits and challenges. Sensitive data on  blockchain can create privacy issues, and companies need to understand data protection laws. Some countries may also have laws restricting blockchain use. Scalability and Energy Consumption As blockchain matures, scalability becomes more difficult to manage. Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum require a lot of computing power, raising concerns about energy consumption and environmental impacts. Lack of standardization There is currently no universal model for using blockchain in  supply chains. Different companies may use different types of blockchain systems, making it difficult to create a unified transaction across the network 6. Future Directions and Potential Developments The future of blockchain in supply chain looks promising with continued advances to address current limitations. When combined with the Internet of Things (IoT), IoT can provide instant tracking information from  sensors. This can further increase traceability as sensors log data to the blockchain, reducing human error. Easy communication leads to improved collaboration. Show.
